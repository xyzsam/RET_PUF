% FLATTENSLICE

% Integrates a 3D slice of an excitation spectrum along one dimension,
% flattening it into a 2D image. The integration dimension is wavelength.
% What is returned is an array of the upper edge of the image.

%       SYNTAX : upperedge = flattenslice(slice) 
%                slice     = 3D slice of an excitation spectrum. First
%                            dimension is wavelength, second dimension is
%                            time.
%                upperedge = the result of integrating the spectrum along
%                            the wavelength dimension.
